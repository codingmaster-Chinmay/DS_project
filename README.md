# DS_project
This repositary has major project for data science project that is online retail recommendation system using various libraries like scikit-learn,numpy, pandas and many more.This also used file handling , user - item matrix , sparse matrix, data cleaning, etc.
This repository contains two interconnected projects:

Online Retail Recommendation System – A machine learning model designed to provide product recommendations based on customer purchase history.
Python Fundamentals – A collection of Python basics and essential programming concepts useful for data science and general-purpose programming.

Objectives
Build a
recommendation system using a real-world retail dataset.
Strengthen foundational Python skills for data analysis and development.

Online Retail Recommendation System
Description
The Online Retail Recommendation System leverages customer purchasing patterns to suggest relevant products, thereby enhancing user experience. It utilizes:

Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for implementing the recommendation model.
Cosine Similarity to measure customer similarities.
Sparse Matrices for efficient memory and computational management.


Features

Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
User-Item Matrix Creation
Similarity Calculation using Cosine Similarity
Product Recommendations based on Similar Customer Purchases
Dataset

The system is built using a retail dataset containing:

CustomerID
StockCode (Product Identifier)
Quantity Purchased
Unit Price

How It Works
Data Cleaning: Removes null values and filters valid transactions.
User-Item Matrix: Constructs a matrix to represent customer purchase behavior.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity scores between customers.
Product Recommendation: Suggests products based on purchases by similar customers.
